### Hack Charlotte 2019

We took data from CSV file provided by 3 medical organizations (via a temporary ssh server) in the Charlotte health care system and visualized it.

To satisfy data security concerns, the data was further anonymised by normalizing the input through a local rust server. 

Data was overlaid atop Google's mapping API.
